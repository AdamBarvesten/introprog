# Life

A computer lab in the introductory programming course at Lund University.

## Usage

**NOTE:** If you are using LTH's computers, you may safely disregard the below and get started on the lab right away!

This lab makes usage of the user interface framework JavaFX.
JavaFX is a relatively recent framework for graphical user interfaces that should work well on all systems with Oracles Java SDK installed.
However, not all Linux systems use the Oracle SDK by default (since it's not open source) and instead use OpenJDK which does not bundle JavaFX.

To use JavaFX on such a system one must also install the OpenJFX package which is supplied by a wide range of distributions.

Install OpenJFX on Ubuntu with the following command:

    sudo apt-get install openjfx

Install OpenJFX on Arch Linux with the following command:

    sudo pacman -S java-openjfx
